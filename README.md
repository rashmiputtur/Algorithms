Implementation of Popular Algorithms

Word Break:                                                                                                                    
Given a dictionary of words and a sentence with whitespace charcaters omitted, find all possibel sentences by insering whitespace characters

Substring:                                                                                                                     
Given a dictionary and an input string, find all dictionary words that are substrings of the input word

Word Boggle:                                                                                                                     
Given a matrix of letters and a dictionary, find all possible valid words from the matrix

GitCommitMsgStats: 

Read the public github dataset from Google BigQuery to compute mean and median of all git commit messages over a time period. The program is written to treat the message lengths as a stream of integers where the median and mean are computes for each message read from BigQuery.
